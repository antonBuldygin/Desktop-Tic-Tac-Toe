<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, you will teach a computer how to play Tic-tac-toe. Add a control panel to choose the sides. You will also need a start button to start the game.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>The computer should have a strategy to play Tic-tac-toe well. You need to develop and implement it. The strategy can be elaborate or very simple, where the computer chooses a random free field. You are free to implement any strategy you want.</p>
<p>Also, add a toolbar with three buttons. These buttons are for selecting players and resetting the game. When you click on the player button, it should change to represent either a human player or a computer. So in total, the program should support four game modes: player versus player, player versus computer, computer versus player, and computer versus computer.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can add a small delay (about a second) when a computer makes a move. This will allow you to follow the game when during computer vs. computer mode.</p>
<p>Set names for these components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nine cells from <code class="java">ButtonA1</code> to <code class="java">ButtonC3</code></li>
<li>Status bar as <code class="java">LabelStatus</code></li>
<li>Player buttons as <code class="java">ButtonPlayer1</code> and <code class="java">ButtonPlayer2</code></li>
<li>Start/Reset button as <code class="java">ButtonStartReset</code></li>
